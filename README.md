# Puzzler 2023

This year the idea was to do something with the programming language "Basic".

I chose to write a compiler that would compile Basic programs (e.g. from http://www.vintage-basic.net/games.html)
to Java byte code.  To do this I am using the [ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) library.

The parser is a classic hand-rolled recursive descent parser that generates an
"abstract syntax tree" (AST).  Then a visitor can be used to walk that tree.  Two
visitors are implemented:

* One that just prints the tree
* One that uses the ASM library to generated byte code

Theoretically it could be possible to have other visitors to generate
other kinds of output.
